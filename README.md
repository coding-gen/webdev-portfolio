# webdev-portfolio

This is a personal portfolio site to showcase the skills I learned in the Caterina Paun's course Introduction to Web Development in spring term of 2022 at Portland State University. The site is hosted in github pages, simply visit https://coding-gen.github.io/webdev-portfolio/index.html to view it.

I would like to thank these sites as resource materials:

- https://www.w3schools.com/
- https://stackoverflow.com/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

I also relied on the TriMet Developer Resources documentation when implementing the TriMet API project page:

- https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/

Additionally I based some pages on code from the homework assignments, so I would like to thank Caterina Paun as a source.
